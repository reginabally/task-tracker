## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or newer)
- npm or yarn
- LM Studio (for local AI processing) or OpenAI API key (for cloud AI processing)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reginabally/task-tracker.git
   cd task-tracker
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Setup the database**
   
   First, rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.

   Then, update the `PERIOD_START_DATE` and `NEXT_START_DATE` values to match your current reporting period (default to 2-weeks).

   Finally, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

4. **Import seed data**

   Review and edit the seed data for task types and tags in `/prisma/seed.ts` if needed. Change the reporting period in `.env`.

   Then run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

   This will populate the database with task types, tags, and initialize the reporting period.

5. **Configure AI Integration**

   For **LM Studio** (local AI, default option):
   - Install LM Studio from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
   - Launch LM Studio and start the local server
   - The default endpoint is set to `http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions`

   For **OpenAI** (cloud AI):
   - Edit the `.env` file
   - Add your OpenAI API key to `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Restart the development server after adding the API key

6. **Build and run the server**
   
   For development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   For production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   # or
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```
