## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- LM Studio (for local AI processing) or OpenAI API key (for cloud AI processing)

### Docker Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reginabally/task-tracker.git
   cd task-tracker
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file if needed to customize your setup.

3. **Build and start the Docker containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will build the Docker image and start the application in detached mode.

4. **Access the application**
   
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You will be automatically redirected to the /tasks page.

5. **Configure AI Integration**

   For **LM Studio** (local AI, default option):
   - Install LM Studio from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai)
   - Launch LM Studio and start the local server
   - Ensure LM Studio is accessible from the Docker container (adjust network settings if needed)
   - The default endpoint is set to `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1/chat/completions` for Mac/Windows or `http://172.17.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions` for Linux

   For **OpenAI** (cloud AI):
   - Launch the application and navigate to Settings â†’ AI Config
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the provided field and click Save
   - Your API key will be stored securely in the database

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/reginabally/task-tracker.git
   cd task-tracker
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Setup the database**
   
   First, rename the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.

   Finally, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

4. **Import seed data**

   Review and edit the seed data for task types and tags in `/prisma/seed.ts` if needed.

   Then run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

   This will populate the database with task types, tags, and initialize the reporting period.

5. **Configure AI Integration**

   Follow the AI integration steps from the Docker setup above.

6. **Build and run the server**
   
   For development:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   For production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   # or
   yarn build
   yarn start
   ```

7. **Access the application**
   
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You will be automatically redirected to the /tasks page.

## Docker Management

### Viewing Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f

### Database Persistence
The SQLite database is stored in a Docker volume to ensure data persistence across container restarts. To backup your data:

```bash
# Find the volume name
docker volume ls
